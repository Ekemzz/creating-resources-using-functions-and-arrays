# creating-resources-using-functions-and-arrays
In DevOps scripting, arrays and functions are essential tools that make automation more efficient and maintainable. Arrays allow you to store and manage multiple values, such as server names or department buckets, and handle them dynamically with loops instead of repeating code. Functions, on the other hand, group commands into reusable, modular blocks that improve readability, reusability, and error handling in scripts. Together, they help automate cloud resource provisioning, deployments, and infrastructure management in a structured, scalable wayâ€”turning simple Bash scripts into powerful automation tools.
